# VegaPolarisTheme
I got sick of the new Next Experience ServiceNow dark mode theme that is still pretty hard on the eyes so I cooked up my own. It's much more muted and is designed to be added as a variant of the core polaris themes for easy installation. It's named after Vega one of the brighest stars in the sky. The update set will add Vega as a variant to the default polaris theme, so after loading if you haven't touched the themeing in your instance it will just be available in the preferences menu, otherwise you might need to add it as a variant to your existing theme and check nothing got too messed up.
